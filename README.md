moldy is a **mol**ecular **dy**namics simulation, using bead and spring dynamics and physically derived forces to simulate polymers etc.

The simulation is run from compiled C++ code.

The simulation can be initialised via python functions provided in moldy.py

The aim is to provide a user friendly front-end utilising python scripting whilst retaining the speed of the C++ program.

Usage examples included in moldy.py

Example outputs included in ./graphicsOutput

compiled with c++20
